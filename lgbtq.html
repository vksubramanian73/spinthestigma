      <h1 class="title2" style="color: #FFB7B2;">LGBTQ+</h1>
      <p class="blurb1" style="background-color: #FFB7B2;">Due to the constant discrimination, oppression and prejudice that the LGBTQ+ community experiences, many individuals are at heightened risk for self-hamr, suicidal feelings and thoughts, and struggles with mental health</p>
      <p class="blurb2" style="background-color: #FFB7B2;"> However, the LGBTQ+ community is diverse and continues to demonstrate strength through solidarity and bringing awareness to these issues. It's important that we all show our support for marginalized communities undergoing discrimination.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: Arvo; font-size: 50px;">How To Help Suicidal LGBTQ+ people</h3>
        <h4 style="font-size: 35px;">Show Allyship!</h4> 
        <p>Straight or cisgender allies should continue to show public support for the LGBTQ+ community, encourage tolerance and acceptance, and actively voice against prejudice in their own communities and circles. LGBTQ+ individuals should validate and emphasize the importance of their identities, and reach out to offer support to other loved ones.
        </p>
        <h4 style="font-size: 35px;">Be Aware of the Facts</h4>
        <p>LGBTQ+ youth are greatly and disproportionately at risk for self-harm: over 80% have been assaulted or threatened, compounding their victimization. 
        <h4 style="font-size: 35px;">Actively listen</h4>
        <p><strong>Be an active listener. </strong> 
            Empathize with, and check on LGBTQ+ loved ones. Always be sure to practice active listening technique and be on the lookout for warning signs (be direct). Have a conversation and get to understand their story.</p>
         </p>
         <h4 style="font-size: 35px;">Encourage family bonding and local support</h4>
        <p><strong>Strong support, tight bonds, safe schools and homes. </strong> 
           Work to bring awareness to and ensure that LGBTQ+ youth have safe spaces and loved ones in their lives to protect them from suicidality and depression.</p>
         </p>
          <h4 style="font-size: 35px;">Emphasize family and community</h4>
        <p><strong>Affirm gender identity. </strong> 
           A recent study showed that transgender youth were as psychologically healthy as their other peers when their identity was validated and affirmed by their family. Support makes a difference through both community and family for the safety of LGBTQ+ children.</p>
